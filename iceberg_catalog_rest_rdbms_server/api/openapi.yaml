      description: " All REST clients should first call this route to get catalog\
        \ configuration properties from the server to configure the catalog and its\
        \ HTTP client. Configuration from the server consists of two sets of key/value\
        \ pairs.\n- defaults -  properties that should be used as default configuration;\
        \ applied before client configuration\n- overrides - properties that should\
        \ be used to override client configuration; applied after defaults and client\
        \ configuration\n\nCatalog configuration is constructed by setting the defaults,\
        \ then client- provided configuration, and finally overrides. The final property\
        \ set is then used to configure the catalog.\n\nFor example, a default configuration\
        \ property might set the size of the client pool, which can be replaced with\
        \ a client-specific setting. An override might be used to set the warehouse\
        \ location, which is stored on the server rather than in client configuration.\n\
        \nCommon catalog configuration settings are documented at https://iceberg.apache.org/configuration/#catalog-properties "

    post:
      description: |-
        Exchange credentials for a token using the OAuth2 client credentials flow or token exchange.

        This endpoint is used for three purposes -
        1. To exchange client credentials (client ID and secret) for an access token This uses the client credentials flow.
        2. To exchange a client token and an identity token for a more specific access token This uses the token exchange flow.
        3. To exchange an access token for one with the same claims and a refreshed expiration period This uses the token exchange flow.

        For example, a catalog client may be configured with client credentials from the OAuth2 Authorization flow. This client would exchange its client ID and secret for an access token using the client credentials request with this endpoint (1). Subsequent requests would then use that access token.

        Some clients may also handle sessions that have additional user context. These clients would use the token exchange flow to exchange a user token (the "subject" token) from the session for a more specific access token for that user, using the catalog's access token as the "actor" token (2). The user ID token is the "subject" token and can be any token type allowed by the OAuth2 token exchange flow, including a unsecured JWT token with a sub claim. This request should use the catalog's bearer token in the "Authorization" header.

        Clients may also use the token exchange flow to refresh a token that is about to expire by sending a token exchange request (3). The request's "subject" token should be the expiring token. This request should use the subject token in the "Authorization" header.

        Create a table or start a create transaction, like atomic CTAS.

        If `stage-create` is false, the table is created immediately.

        If `stage-create` is true, the table is not created, but table metadata is initialized and returned. The service should prepare as needed for a commit to the table commit endpoint to complete the create transaction. The client uses the returned metadata to begin a transaction. To commit the transaction, the client sends all create and subsequent changes to the table commit route. Changes from the table create operation include changes like AddSchemaUpdate and SetCurrentSchemaUpdate that set the initial table state.

        The response contains both configuration and table metadata. The configuration, if non-empty is used as additional configuration for the table that overrides catalog configuration. For example, this configuration may change the FileIO implemented used for the table.

        The response also contains the table's full metadata.

        The catalog configuration may contain credentials that should be used for subsequent requests for the table. The configuration key "token" is used to pass an access token to be used as a bearer token for table requests. Otherwise, a token may be passed using a RFC 8693 token type as a configuration key. For example, "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt=<JWT-token>".

        Commit updates to a table.

        Commits have two parts, requirements and updates. Requirements are assertions that will be validated before attempting to make and commit changes. For example, `assert-ref-snapshot-id` will check that a named ref's snapshot ID has a certain value.

        Updates are changes to make to table metadata. For example, after asserting that the current main ref is at the expected snapshot, a commit may add a new child snapshot and set the ref to the new snapshot id.

        Create table transactions that are started by createTable with `stage-create` set to true are committed using this route. Transactions should include all changes to the table, including table initialization, like AddSchemaUpdate and SetCurrentSchemaUpdate. The `assert-create` requirement is used to ensure that the table was not created concurrently.

    LoadTableResult:
      description: |-
        Result used when a table is successfully loaded.

        The table metadata JSON is returned in the `metadata` field. The corresponding file location of table metadata should be returned in the `metadata-location` field, unless the metadata is not yet committed. For example, a create transaction may return metadata that is staged but not committed. Clients can check whether metadata has changed by comparing metadata locations after the table has been created.

        The `config` map returns table-specific configuration for the table's resources, including its HTTP client and FileIO. For example, config may contain a specific FileIO implementation class for the table depending on its underlying storage.
      example:
        metadata:
